      <h1>Saikumar Thangalla acts in a play</h1>
      <h3>Name of the play: Hedda Gabler</h3>
      <h3>Author: Henrik Ibsen</h3>
      <h2>|| HEDDA GABLER-HENRIK IBSEN ||</h2>

      <p>
        The room at the TESMANS' as in the first Act, except that the piano has
        been removed, and an elegant little writing-table with the book-shelves
        put in its place. A smaller table stands near the sofa on the left. Most
        of the bouquets have been taken away. MRS. ELVSTED'S bouquet is upon the
        large table in front.--It is afternoon. HEDDA, dressed to receive
        callers, is alone in the room. She stands by the open glass door,
        loading a revolver. The fellow to it lies in an open pistol-case on the
        writing- table.

<h4>HEDDA</h4>

[Looks down the garden, and calls:] <p>So you are here again, Judge!</p>

<h4>BRACK</h4>

[Is heard calling from a distance.] <p>As you see, Mrs. Tesman!</p>
        
<h4>HEDDA.</h4>

[Raises the pistol and points.] <p>Now I'll shoot you, Judge Brack!</p>


<h4>BRACK.</h4>

[Calling unseen.] <p>No, no, no! Don't stand aiming at me!/<p>


<h4>HEDDA.</h4>

<p>This is what comes of sneaking in by the back way.(7) </p> [She fires.


<h4>BRACK.</h4>

[Nearer.] <p>Are you out of your senses--!</p>


<h4>HEDDA.</h4>

<p>Dear me--did I happen to hit you?</p>


<h4>BRACK.</h4>

[Still outside.] <p>I wish you would let these pranks alone!</p>


<h4>HEDDA.</h4>

<p>Come in then, Judge.

JUDGE BRACK, dressed as though for a men's party, enters by
the glass door.  He carries a light overcoat over his arm.</p>


<h4>BRACK.</h4>

<p>What the deuce--haven't you tired of that sport, yet? What are you
shooting at?</p>
