        <h4> MISS TESMAN.</h4>

        [Stops close to the door, listens, and says softly:]
        <p> Upon my word, I
        don't believe they are stirring yet!</p>
        
        
        <h4 >BERTA.</h4>

        
        [Also softly.]
        <p>I told you so, Miss. Remember how late the steamboat got
        in last night. And then, when they got home!--good Lord, what a lot the
        young mistress had to unpack before she could get to bed.</p>
        
        <h4>MISS TESMAN.</h4>
        
        Well well--let them have their sleep out. But let us see that they get a
        good breath of the fresh morning air when they do appear.
        
             [She goes to the glass door and throws it open.]
        
        
        <h4>BERTA.</h4>
        
        [Beside the table, at a loss what to do with the bouquet in her hand.]
        <P>
        I declare there isn't a bit of room left. I think I'll put it down here,
        Miss.</P>
        [She places it on the piano.]
        
        
       <h4> MISS TESMAN.</h4>
        <P>
        So you've got a new mistress now, my dear Berta. Heaven knows it was a
        wrench to me to part with you.</P>
        
        
        <h4>BERTA.</h4>
        
        [On the point of weeping.] <P>And do you think it wasn't hard for me, too,
        Miss? After all the blessed years I've been with you and Miss Rina.(1)</P>
        
        
        <h4>MISS TESMAN.</h4>
        <P>
        We must make the best of it, Berta. There was nothing else to be done.
        George can't do without you, you see-he absolutely can't. He has had you
        to look after him ever since he was a little boy.
      </P>
        
        
        <h4>BERTA.</h4>
        <P>
        Ah but, Miss Julia, I can't help thinking of Miss Rina lying helpless
        at home there, poor thing. And with only that new girl too! She'll never
        learn to take proper care of an invalid.
      </P>
        
        
       <h4> MISS TESMAN.</h4>
        <P>
        Oh, I shall manage to train her. And of course, you know, I shall take
        most of it upon myself. You needn't be uneasy about my poor sister, my
        dear Berta.
      </P>
        
       <h4> BERTA.</h4>
        <P>
        Well, but there's another thing, Miss. I'm so mortally afraid I shan't
        be able to suit the young mistress.
      </P>
