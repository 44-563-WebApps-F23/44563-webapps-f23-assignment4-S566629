      <h3>Name of the play: Hedda Gabler</h3>
      <h3>Author: Henrik Ibsen</h3>
      <h2>|| HEDDA GABLER-HENRIK IBSEN ||</h2>

      <p>
        The room at the TESMANS' as in the first Act, except that the piano has
        been removed, and an elegant little writing-table with the book-shelves
        put in its place. A smaller table stands near the sofa on the left. Most
        of the bouquets have been taken away. MRS. ELVSTED'S bouquet is upon the
        large table in front.--It is afternoon. HEDDA, dressed to receive
        callers, is alone in the room. She stands by the open glass door,
        loading a revolver. The fellow to it lies in an open pistol-case on the
        writing- table.

HEDDA

[Looks down the garden, and calls:] So you are here again, Judge!

BRACK

[Is heard calling from a distance.] As you see, Mrs. Tesman!
        
HEDDA.

[Raises the pistol and points.] Now I'll shoot you, Judge Brack!


BRACK.

[Calling unseen.] No, no, no! Don't stand aiming at me!


HEDDA.

This is what comes of sneaking in by the back way.(7) [She fires.


BRACK.

[Nearer.] Are you out of your senses--!


HEDDA.

Dear me--did I happen to hit you?


BRACK.

[Still outside.] I wish you would let these pranks alone!


HEDDA.

Come in then, Judge.

JUDGE BRACK, dressed as though for a men's party, enters by
the glass door.  He carries a light overcoat over his arm.


BRACK.

What the deuce--haven't you tired of that sport, yet? What are you
shooting at?
